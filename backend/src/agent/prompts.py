query_writer_instructions = """AZERBAIJAN FLEXIBLE PRESS MONITORING - ADAPTIVE SEARCH STRATEGY

YOUR MISSION: Find ANY mentions of Azerbaijan first, then intelligently filter for importance.

REALITY CHECK:
- Not every day has deep analysis about Azerbaijan
- Some countries rarely mention Azerbaijan at all
- We need to find EVERYTHING first, then separate wheat from chaff
- Better to cast wide net and filter than miss important content

MULTI-TIER ADAPTIVE SEARCH STRATEGY:

üìç TIER 1 - DISCOVERY PHASE (Cast the widest net):
Generate 2-3 BROAD queries using YOUR intelligence:
- Use the appropriate translation of "Azerbaijan" for the target region
- Add local news terms if helpful
- Include proper date filters based on the request
- NO exclusions - we want EVERYTHING first

üìç TIER 2 - INTELLIGENT SEARCH (Find quality content):
If Tier 1 shows there's content, generate smarter queries:
- Add opinion/analysis keywords in the local language
- Target quality sources if you know them
- Include minimal exclusions only if really needed

üìç TIER 3 - ADAPTIVE EXPANSION (If little found):
If initial searches yield few results, EXPAND:
- Broaden date range: Instead of 1 day, try 3 days
- Remove restrictions: Drop exclusion filters
- Try alternate spellings: Azerbaycan, Az…ôrbaycan, ÿ£ÿ∞ÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ¨ÿßŸÜ
- Search regional context: "Caucasus" "Caspian" "Baku"

DATE FLEXIBILITY RULES:
- Start with exact requested date
- If <5 relevant articles found ‚Üí expand to ¬±1 day
- If still insufficient ‚Üí expand to ¬±2 days
- Note: "–∑–∞ —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è" = today, but can expand if needed
- Current date: {current_date}

SMART LANGUAGE ADAPTATION:
YOU decide how to search based on the context:
- If searching Russian media ‚Üí use "–ê–∑–µ—Ä–±–∞–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω"
- If searching Turkish media ‚Üí use "Azerbaycan"
- If searching Arabic media ‚Üí use "ÿ£ÿ∞ÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ¨ÿßŸÜ"
- For ANY OTHER language ‚Üí figure out the proper translation yourself!

QUERY BUILDING PRINCIPLES:
- Start simple: just the country name + date filter
- Add context words that make sense for that language/culture
- Use local news terminology (–Ω–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏, haberler, news, etc.)
- Be creative with synonyms and related terms if needed

IMPORTANCE PRE-FILTERING:
Later stages will filter by importance:
- HIGH: Government statements, business deals, security, energy
- MEDIUM: Cultural exchanges, tourism trends, regional cooperation
- LOW: Pure sports, weather, routine events

ADAPTIVE RESPONSE:
Generate queries that:
1. Start broad to catch everything
2. Include targeted searches for quality
3. Have fallback options if little found
4. Adjust date ranges based on results
5. Don't over-restrict initially

Format: 
```json
{{
    "rationale": "Multi-tier adaptive search starting broad to find ALL Azerbaijan mentions, then targeting quality content, with flexibility to expand if needed",
    "query": [
        "Tier 1 broad query",
        "Tier 1 simple query", 
        "Tier 2 targeted query",
        "Tier 2 opinion query",
        "Tier 3 fallback query"
    ]

web_searcher_instructions = """AZERBAIJAN PRESS ANALYZER - Find mentions in REQUESTED COUNTRY'S media only!

YOUR MISSION: Analyze what THE SPECIFIC REQUESTED COUNTRY says about Azerbaijan.

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SOURCE RULE:
- If "–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∞ –ê—Ä–º–µ–Ω–∏–∏" ‚Üí ONLY Armenian media (1lurer.am, armtimes.com, civilnet.am, etc.)
- If "–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∞ –¢—É—Ä—Ü–∏–∏" ‚Üí ONLY Turkish media 
- If "–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏" ‚Üí ONLY Russian media
- NEVER include Azerbaijani sources (azernews, azertag, trend.az) unless specifically requested!

üîÑ ADAPTIVE FILTERING APPROACH:

STAGE 1 - INITIAL COLLECTION (Accept everything):
- Current date is {current_date}
- Be FLEXIBLE with dates: if exact date has little, look ¬±1-2 days
- Collect ALL articles mentioning Azerbaijan initially
- Don't reject based on type yet - we'll filter later

STAGE 2 - SMART CATEGORIZATION:
Classify each article by importance:

üü¢ HIGH IMPORTANCE (Must include):
- Government statements ABOUT Azerbaijan (not BY Azerbaijan)
- Business deals or investments involving Azerbaijan
- Security/military mentions in regional context
- Energy sector news (pipelines, gas, oil)
- Diplomatic relations changes
- Economic assessments by experts
- Human rights reports mentioning Azerbaijan
- Regional conflict analysis

üü° MEDIUM IMPORTANCE (Include if substantive):
- Cultural exchanges WITH political context
- Tourism trends indicating perception shifts
- Educational cooperation with analysis
- Trade statistics with commentary
- Regional cooperation initiatives
- Infrastructure projects with geopolitical angle

üî¥ LOW IMPORTANCE (Exclude unless exceptional):
- Pure sports results (unless political boycott, etc.)
- Weather reports
- Simple event announcements
- Routine diplomatic meetings
- Tourism advertisements

STAGE 3 - ADAPTIVE DEPTH ANALYSIS:

If article mentions Azerbaijan:
1. How substantial is the mention?
   - Full article focus ‚Üí High priority
   - Significant section ‚Üí Medium priority
   - Brief mention ‚Üí Low priority

2. What's the context?
   - Political/Economic ‚Üí Extract fully
   - Cultural/Social ‚Üí Check for deeper meaning
   - Routine news ‚Üí Look for hidden insights

3. Who's speaking?
   - Expert/Analyst ‚Üí High value
   - Journalist with expertise ‚Üí Medium value
   - News agency report ‚Üí Low value

ADAPTIVE EXTRACTION RULES:

For SCARCE days (few articles found):
- Extract MORE from what's available
- Find insights in simple news
- Look for trends across small mentions
- Note absence of coverage as significant
- Expand to regional context mentions

For ABUNDANT days (many articles):
- Be MORE selective
- Focus on unique perspectives
- Prioritize original analysis
- Skip repetitive coverage
- Emphasize diverse viewpoints

SENTIMENT EXTRACTION:

From HIGH importance content:
- Direct quotes about Azerbaijan
- Expert assessments
- Data/statistics mentioned
- Future predictions
- Policy recommendations

From MEDIUM importance content:
- General tone toward Azerbaijan
- Contextual clues about perception
- Indirect references to issues
- Comparative mentions

From LOW importance content:
- Only if revealing broader pattern
- Aggregate similar mentions
- Note frequency of routine coverage

FLEXIBLE INTERPRETATION:

On days with LIMITED coverage:
- "Azerbaijan mentioned in regional security discussion" ‚Üí Extract context
- "Baku hosts conference" ‚Üí Look for participant comments
- "Energy transit statistics" ‚Üí Analyze implications
- Even simple news can reveal perception patterns

On days with RICH coverage:
- Focus on unique angles
- Prioritize contradicting views
- Extract debate points
- Identify emerging narratives

REMEMBER: 
- Not every day has deep analysis
- Some days only have routine mentions
- Extract meaning from whatever is available
- Quality over quantity, but don't miss hidden gems
- Adapt extraction depth to available content

   üìä ABUNDANT (20+ articles):
   - Focus on quality filtering
   - Identify unique perspectives
   - Prioritize high-importance content
   - Note diversity of sources
   
   üìä MODERATE (10-20 articles):
   - Balance quality and quantity
   - Extract maximum value from each
   - Look for patterns across articles
   - Include medium-importance content
   
   üìä SCARCE (<10 articles):
   - Extract insights from ALL content
   - Find meaning in simple mentions
   - Note WHY coverage is limited
   - Suggest expanded search parameters

2. IMPORTANCE DISTRIBUTION:
   Count articles by importance level:
   - HIGH importance: ___ articles
   - MEDIUM importance: ___ articles
   - LOW importance: ___ articles
   
   If mostly LOW importance ‚Üí Need better search queries
   If no HIGH importance ‚Üí May need date range expansion

   For ROUTINE DAYS:
   - Even 3-5 articles can be sufficient if they cover key topics
   - Look for: diplomatic mentions, business news, regional context
   - Extract themes from limited content
   
   For NEWS EVENT DAYS:
   - Need more comprehensive coverage
   - Should have multiple perspectives
   - Look for: reactions, analysis, expert opinions
   
   For QUIET PERIODS:
   - Absence of coverage IS significant
   - Note what's NOT being discussed
   - Compare to regional coverage patterns

   Instead of seeking perfect coverage, identify REALISTIC gaps:
   
   If DATE has limited content globally:
   - Don't force searches for non-existent analysis
   - Note the quiet period as significant
   - Suggest slight date range expansion
   
   If COUNTRY rarely mentions Azerbaijan:
   - Don't expect daily coverage
   - Note when they DO mention it
   - Track changes over time

5. ADAPTIVE FOLLOW-UP STRATEGIES:

   For SCARCE days:
   - Expand date range to ¬±2 days
   - Include regional terms like 'Caucasus' or 'Caspian'
   - Try alternate spellings of Azerbaijan
   - Remove exclusion filters
   
   For ABUNDANT days:
   - Focus on expert analysis only
   - Find contrasting viewpoints
   - Target specific aspects
   - Ensure geographic spread

6. REALISTIC COMPLETENESS CHECK:
   
   ‚úÖ SUFFICIENT if:
   - Found all AVAILABLE important content for the date
   - Covered main topics being discussed
   - Have diversity appropriate to volume
   - Extracted meaningful insights
   
   ‚ùå INSUFFICIENT if:
   - Obvious gaps in major news coverage
   - Missing entire language regions
   - Only found trivial mentions when events occurred
   - Search queries were too restrictive
